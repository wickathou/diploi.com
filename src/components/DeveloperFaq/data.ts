Since your application runs each deployment in an isolated infrastructure, you could have one core production deployment to serve users in a multi-tenant environment, and when you need to create a single-tenant version for a different client, you can clone your production deployment, reset its databases, and have a clean deployment ready in record time. All with the necessary infrastructure fully provisioned, running completely isolated from the rest of your deployments and other users.",

 question: "What's the difference between components and add-ons?",
 answer:
      "Components are the application layers your users interact with, like frontends (React, Next.js, Astro) and backends (Node.js, Python, etc.). Add-ons are supporting services like databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB), caching (Redis), and file storage (MinIO) that are only accessible by the components that are part of the same deployment.",
