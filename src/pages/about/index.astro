        <p>
          Happily based in <span class="text-gradient">Helsinki, Finland</span> 🇫🇮, we are an agile and very focused team, working since 2023
          on removing all busy work from the developer workflow.
          <br /><br />
          More specifically, the busy work we had to do on a regular basis while running a successful software agency. Things like:
          <br /><br />
          - <b>Every new project requires a fresh setup</b>, a new GitHub repo, add CI/CD, SSL certificates, Staging, and Production
          environments and a way to share test environments, plus setting up the initial scaffold that will be used as a starting point.
          <br /><br />
          - <b>Developer environment drift</b>, which led to the horrifying sentence "Works on my machine". ENV variables are not in sync,
          dependencies were installed globally but not in the project.
          <br /><br />
          - <b>Onboarding being too slow</b>, so new team members spend a disproportionate amount of time configuring their environment,
          installing dependencies, and debugging setup issues instead of contributing.
          <br /><br />
          - <b>Context switching is fight</b>, for developers working across multiple projects, a "minor" change ends up being a major
          struggle. They must switch Node versions, or activate the right virtual environment, or shut down a Docker container to enable a
          different one, or switch databases, and many more issues like that.
          <br /><br />
          Working on multiple projects, either as a freelancer or running an agency, comes with these "busy" work costs that add up quickly.
          <br /><br />
          And this is non-billable work. <b>The kind of work that leads to burnout</b>.
          <br /><br />
          We decided we had enough with this situation and with a simple question:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Why is so much developer time wasted on things that aren't actually building software? Between environment setup, configuration
          management, and keeping dev/staging/production in sync, teams lose hours every week to work that doesn't move the product forward.
        </blockquote>
        <b class="text-gradient">We set out to fix that.</b>
        <p>
          With our small team and ambition, we created a platform we are proud of, fixing our own problem and making development much more
          enjoyable.

          Diploi began when Marcus, Patrik, and Tuomas, who wanted to spend more time shipping code than reconfiguring their local
          environments every time they needed to switch projects. In early 2024, they got the MVP ready and started actively testing it and
          gathering feedback from early users.
          <br /><br />
          With the early success of the platform, the team raised pre-seed funding by September 2024, which allowed us to take the MVP into a
          polished product.
          <br /><br />
          In 2025, the team grew! First, Javier joined to help spread the word, and Giao came on board to accelerate our development cycles.
          <br /><br />
          By December 2025, we hit 1,000 registered users! By the end of the year, we had support for Python, PHP, C#, and .NET. We added Ghost,
          Supabase, n8n, MinIO, and MariaDB. We built integrations with AI coding tools so developers can use LLMs without having to add API keys,
          and made it easy to import projects from Lovable, Next.js, React, and Node.js.
          <br /><br />
          We are on a mission! 🫡

        <p>
          We trust the people in our team to do great work, without having anyone looking over their shoulders.
          <br /><br />
          We do not like micromanagement, we do not ask for constant check-ins, or wasting time with meetings to look busy. You own your work,
          you manage your time, and you keep the team in the loop.
          <br /><br />
          That's our way. 😌
          <br /><br />
          Even though we care about shipping fast, we know that there's more to life than work, so we encourage our team to touch grass as often
          as possible, and prioritize your long-term health over short-term speed.
          <br /><br />
          A sustainable pace wins over time. Go outside. Take your evenings back. We're building something for the long haul.
