## Our first press release!

We recently launched our first press release, and since this is a blog for all things Diploi, it makes sense to share the press release here as well.

### Diploi launches to bridge the development gap between vibe coding and production-ready software

**HELSINKI, Finland (18 December 2025)** Helsinki-based developer platform Diploi today announced the full launch of Diploi.com, a single SaaS platform designed to streamline development, testing, and production for developers, teams, and agencies. By reducing environment setup headaches and DevOps overhead, Diploi empowers teams to build, test, and deploy software reliably and efficiently.

The path from experimenting quickly with vibe coding to working on production-ready apps requires significant effort to follow. While AI app-builders like Lovable make it easy for developers of all skill levels to create concepts, the end product suffers if prompts do not take architectural complexity into account, with small changes often leading to unexpected issues in the underlying code. 

From vibe coding to production, Diploi solves this by providing consistent environments, zero-install remote development, one-click environment setup, and support for any stack, eliminating the need to constantly switch between projects and contexts. 

Early user feedback has been positive, with Artha CTO Kim Sandell appreciating how Diploi enables a more efficient and streamlined development workflow. “The platform’s speed and simplicity are major advantages, and being able to operate without any DevOps overhead has saved us significant time. Making changes through the web editor is remarkably fast, and the automated branch-push deployment to Diploi is far easier than using traditional CI/CD pipelines.”

With Lovable reaching a $6 billion valuation just two years after being founded and the global vibe-coding market projected to hit $325 billion by 2040, adoption of these tools is set to scale, as is the opportunity for tools that bridge the gap between vibe and real-world coding.

“Vibe coding has massively lowered the barrier to entry for building apps for fun. While the result may be shiny, what's behind might be quite awful,” said Marcus Ahlfors, Founder of Diploi. “People will need something else to get these prototypes to production. We built Diploi for people who want one place to make great apps with the tools they love. We eliminate overheads that slow teams while providing consistent environments, one-click onboarding, and full-stack support — so more experienced developers can focus on building real, production-ready apps, using vibe coding or not.”

A recent Diploi developer survey found 68% of respondents reported moderate to high effort in setting up and managing development and production environments, whereas 73% said creating and sharing test environments was similarly burdensome. Surprisingly, only 11.6% were fully using remote development tools, highlighting the need for more zero-install remote environments.

“We actually love vibe coding – it’s one of the amazing range of tools available to devs today, and more are sure to come. As the market continues to develop, we plan to continuously expand integrations, improve AI-assisted workflows, and make Diploi the go-to platform for teams and agencies looking to ship real software reliably,” concludes Ahlfors.
