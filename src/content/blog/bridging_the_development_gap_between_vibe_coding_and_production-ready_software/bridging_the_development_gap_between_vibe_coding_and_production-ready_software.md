As the year comes to a close, 2025 has been intense! So we took some time to look back at what happened.

![The team of Diploi](diploi-team.jpg)

This is us, the people behind Diploi! From left to right, Giao, Patrik, Marcus, Javier, and Tuomas.

Nice to meet you!

## What happened in 2025, a quick recap

Diploi started in 2024, where the team was [only 3 people](/blog/hi-from-diploi-52j9), composed by [Tuomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/munkkeli/), [Patrik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patriklindberg/), [Marcus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcusahlfors/), focused on building a product that would help developers use their time to do more of the actual fun coding, and less of the boring and repetitive config work. And they were successful on that!

So when 2025 came around, the product reached a stage where it was ready for actual users, so the need of actively promoting the product to developers grew, which is why Javier ([I'm the one writing](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javierjhm/)) joined the team in February.

By August, Diploi became a bit too complex for only 2 people to work on features and fix bugs, so the team started to look for a talented developer to keep growing the product, and after a short search, [Giao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/giao-ngo/) joined the team! Her onboarding was sooo quick that just in her first week, she was already pushing a massive pull request, with new features and bug fixes. It was like she learned the entire product by day two!

With our team now being 5 people, constantly working on new features, improvements, and fixes, we have built an amazing team dynamic, and we are constantly pushing for more!

Moving forward to now, at the beginning of December, we reached the mark of getting 1000 registered users! We released a long list of features that put us in a premium spot to start 2026, and go even bigger! Just to list a few of the most notable improvements in Diploi, we have:

- Support for Python, PHP, C#, and .NET
- Added Ghost, Supabase, and n8n, to build even more complex applications on Diploi
- Launched MinIO as a file storage system and MariaDB for SQL-based backends
- New ready-to-use LLM support with Claude, and ChatGPT Codex, to vibe-code within the browser IDE instantly
- Implemented a way to import existing applications from Lovable, Next.js, React, and Node.js applications

So yes, a lot happened, but one thing we didn't have a chance to do was launch a proper press release about Diploi and our mission.

Until now. 😎

## Our first press release!

We partnered with [San Francisco](https://sanfrancisco.fi/), a well-known public relations agency based in Helsinki, to do our first press release. They did a great job, and we already got attention from international publications, talking about Diploi and our mission.

Since this is a blog for all things Diploi, it makes sense to share the press release here as well.

### Diploi launches to bridge the development gap between vibe coding and production-ready software

Vibe coding enables faster experimentation and idea deployment, but many popular tools lack the scope needed to take projects from prototype to production. Diploi bridges this gap, reducing DevOps overhead and enabling teams to build, test, and host on a single platform.

HELSINKI, Finland (18 December 2025) Helsinki-based developer platform Diploi today announced the full launch of Diploi.com, a single SaaS platform designed to streamline development, testing, and production for developers, teams, and agencies. By reducing environment setup headaches and DevOps overhead, Diploi empowers teams to build, test, and deploy software reliably and efficiently.

The path from experimenting quickly with vibe coding to working on production-ready apps requires significant effort to follow. While AI app-builders like Lovable make it easy for developers of all skill levels to create concepts, the end product suffers if prompts do not take architectural complexity into account, with small changes often leading to unexpected issues in the underlying code. 

From vibe coding to production, Diploi solves this by providing consistent environments, zero-install remote development, one-click environment setup, and support for any stack, eliminating the need to constantly switch between projects and contexts. 

Early user feedback has been positive, with Artha CTO Kim Sandell appreciating how Diploi enables a more efficient and streamlined development workflow. “The platform’s speed and simplicity are major advantages, and being able to operate without any DevOps overhead has saved us significant time. Making changes through the web editor is remarkably fast, and the automated branch-push deployment to Diploi is far easier than using traditional CI/CD pipelines.”

With Lovable reaching a $6 billion valuation just two years after being founded and the global vibe-coding market projected to hit $325 billion by 2040, adoption of these tools is set to scale, as is the opportunity for tools that bridge the gap between vibe and real-world coding.

“Vibe coding has massively lowered the barrier to entry for building apps for fun. While the result may be shiny, what's behind might be quite awful,” said Marcus Ahlfors, Founder of Diploi. “People will need something else to get these prototypes to production. We built Diploi for people who want one place to make great apps with the tools they love. We eliminate overheads that slow teams while providing consistent environments, one-click onboarding, and full-stack support — so more experienced developers can focus on building real, production-ready apps, using vibe coding or not.”

A recent Diploi developer survey found 68% of respondents reported moderate to high effort in setting up and managing development and production environments, whereas 73% said creating and sharing test environments was similarly burdensome. Surprisingly, only 11.6% were fully using remote development tools, highlighting the need for more zero-install remote environments.

“We actually love vibe coding – it’s one of the amazing range of tools available to devs today, and more are sure to come. As the market continues to develop, we plan to continuously expand integrations, improve AI-assisted workflows, and make Diploi the go-to platform for teams and agencies looking to ship real software reliably,” concludes Ahlfors.

## Closing thoughts

It took a lot of effort to get here, and it almost feels like the year happened within a month... But it was worth it!

As we look forward to 2026, we hope you have enjoyed this journey as much as we have

And from everyone in Diploi, we wish you a happy New Year! 🎆
